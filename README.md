# 🕒 Digital Clock — Time Never Looked This Cool

Welcome to the **Digital Clock** project!  
It’s not just a clock… it’s a *statement*.

## 📸 Preview

Here’s what you’ll see when it’s running (minus your boss walking by 👀):

## 🤓 How It Works

The JavaScript fetches the current time every second

It updates:

Numbers → Hours, Minutes, Seconds

Circle progress bars using stroke-dashoffset

Orbit dots with transform: rotate(...)

CSS variables (--color) make it easy to theme the rings 🔥

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Because time is precious… and if we’re going to watch it slip away,
it might as well look awesome while doing it. ❤️

---
## 💡 Ideas to Improve

Add dark/light mode toggle 🌗

Make it clickable to change time zones 🌍

Let users pick their own colors 🎨

Add background animations to match the time of day
